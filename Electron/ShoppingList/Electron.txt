Before Running the webapp use these commands in terminal where your files are saved without text file :-

1. npm install --save electron

2. 
  if on mac
   npm run package-mac
  
  if on windows
	
  npm run package-win


  if on linux
  
  npm run package-linux


 After this a folder is created named "released-builds"
